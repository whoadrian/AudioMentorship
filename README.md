# Welcome to the Audio Mentorship project, in Unreal & Wwise!

Here you can download the Unreal projects set up for the Audio Workgroup Discord server.
It is based on the Stack-O-Bot Unreal demo project, with a Wwise integration & lots of other cool stuff added by us!

## Downloading the project

Simply click on the 'Code' button and hit 'Download as zip'.

If you'd like to use git to clone the repo, make sure to download & run the [AudioMentorship.bat](https://github.com/whoadrian/AudioMentorship/blob/main/AudioMentorshipSetup.bat) script before cloning.
This will simply set some global git parameters that allows you to download the full repo in one go.
For most, the default git setup fails mid-way through downloading due to its size.


Have fun!
