# Welcome to the Audio Mentorship project, in Unreal & Wwise!

Here you can download the Unreal projects set up for the Audio Workgroup Discord server.

## Downloading the projects

Simply click on the 'Code' button and hit 'Download as zip'.

If you'd like to use git to clone the repo, make sure to run the AudioMentorshipSetup.bat script before cloning. This will simply set some global git parameters that allows you to download the full repo in one go. For most, the default git setup fails mid-way through downloading.


Have fun!
